# Passwordless Server

## TODO

- [x] basic auth with register and login functionality
- [ ] make all the fido settings configurable
- [ ] adding multiple authenticators(devices)
- [ ] login with one time codes
- [ ] tests
- [ ] make sure that users can register if their registration fails once, currently it gives you an error that the entered email already exists
- [ ] `authenticatorUserVerification: 'preferred',` - setting a value prevents warning in chrome
